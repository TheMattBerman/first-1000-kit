**An open-source AI GTM system that replaces a $150K hire with ~$100/month in tools.**

## What It Does

```
LinkedIn Engagement → Verified Emails → Personalized Outreach → Booked Meetings
```

This kit automates the entire top-of-funnel GTM process:

1. **Mine LinkedIn** — Find people engaging with niche content (warm leads, not cold lists)
2. **Add X/Twitter signals** - Optionally search tweets, replies, followers, and launch conversations with TweetClaw
3. **Enrich** - Get verified work emails via Hunter.io + Apollo
4. **Score** - Rank leads against your ICP (A/B/C/D tiers)
5. **Write** - Generate hyper-personalized cold emails using AI
6. **Send** - Load into Instantly.ai sequences

**The result:** A full pipeline from "who's talking about my space?" to "meeting booked" — running on autopilot.

## Why This Exists

I've spent 20 years in marketing. Scaled Fireball Whisky from one state to a billion-dollar global brand. Ran campaigns for Heineken, Hennessy, Buffalo Trace. Now I run [Emerald Digital](https://emerald.digital), an AI-first marketing agency.

Here's what I learned: **Most startups can't afford a GTM engineer.** So founders do outbound manually (slow), hire too early (expensive), or skip it entirely (fatal).

This kit is the system I wish I had. It does what a $150K/year GTM hire does — for about $100/month in API costs.

I'm open-sourcing it because the best marketing happens when founders can actually reach their customers.

## How It Works

### The Pipeline

```

```

### Why LinkedIn Engagement?

Traditional outbound scrapes LinkedIn for titles and blasts generic emails. Response rates: 1-2%.

This system finds people **actively engaging with content in your niche**. They commented on a post about AI marketing? They're already thinking about it. That's a warm lead.

Response rates with warm + personalized: 8-15%.

### Optional X/Twitter Signals

For launches, creator-led markets, or niches where buyers talk on X/Twitter, use [TweetClaw](https://github.com/Xquik-dev/tweetclaw) as an optional OpenClaw plugin before enrichment:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.apiKey "$XQUIK_API_KEY"
openclaw config set tools.alsoAllow '["explore", "tweetclaw"]'
```

Use it to search tweets, search tweet replies, export followers, look up users, monitor launch keywords, and capture tweet URLs or handles as reviewed lead context. Keep LinkedIn as the primary source in this kit, then use TweetClaw when X/Twitter conversations reveal who is discussing your niche, competitors, product category, or giveaway.

---

## Configuration

### Brand & ICP

Edit `brand-config.json` to define:

```json
{
  "icp": {
    "target_titles": ["VP Marketing", "Head of Growth", "CMO"],
    "target_industries": ["SaaS", "E-commerce"],
    "company_size": { "min": 50, "max": 500 }
  },
  "outreach": {
    "sender_name": "Your Name",
    "tone": "professional but conversational",
    "pain_points": ["Problem 1 you solve", "Problem 2"]
  }
}
```

Or just tell the OpenClaw agent your ICP conversationally — it'll figure it out.

---

## Costs

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|--------------|
| RapidAPI | ~$30-50 |
| Hunter.io | Free - $50 |
| Instantly.ai | $30 |
| **Total** | **~$60-130/mo** |

**vs hiring a GTM engineer:** $150,000/year

## Running with OpenClaw

This kit is built for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), an open-source AI agent framework.

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw

# Copy kit to workers directory
cp -r first-1000-kit ~/clawd/workers/first-1000

# Start the agent
cd ~/clawd/workers/first-1000
openclaw start
```

Then just message it naturally:

- "Mine LinkedIn for people talking about AI automation"
- "Enrich and score against my ICP"  
- "Write outreach for A-tier leads"
- "Load to Instantly"

The agent handles the orchestration.
